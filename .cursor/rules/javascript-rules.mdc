#Code Style and Structure:
- Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.
- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

#Naming Conventions:
- Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
- Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).
- Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

#JavaScript Usage:
- Avoid Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects.
- Use ES6+ Features: Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise code.
- PropTypes: Use PropTypes for type checking in components.

#Performance Optimization:
- Optimize State Management: Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed.
- Avoid Anonymous Functions: Refrain from using anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.
